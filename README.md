The final project for this course consisted of a comprehensive analysis of sales data, including descriptive statistics, regression modeling, and data visualization. You likely explored relationships between various sales metrics, analyzed sales patterns across different product lines and customer types, and created predictive models to understand factors influencing sales performance. 

The core of my work is evident in the R scripts for descriptive analysis ("Group8_project_descriptive_analysis2.R") and multiple regression analyses ("regression_2.R", "regression_final.R", and "regression_final_project.R"). =

I created a variety of graphs that offer insights into different aspects of the sales data. These include boxplots showing total sales distribution by customer type, scatter plots examining relationships between COGS, gross income, and quantity, histograms of total sales, frequency plots of product lines, and charts displaying average sales by hour. These visualizations serve to illustrate key patterns and trends in the data.

For documentation purposes, you prepared a dataset description document ("Dataset Description.docx") and compiled project graphs in a separate file ("Group8_Project_Graphs.docx").
